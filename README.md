## 📖 Overview

**Vellum** is a high-performance social media scheduler designed for the "distribution-first" era. Built with a focus on **Neo-minimalist UI** and **Lottie-driven interactions**, Vellum allows creators to treat social media like a physical canvas—scheduling across a dozen platforms simultaneously while maintaining platform-specific nuances.

This project repurposes the sophisticated, grid-heavy design language of Attio to solve the complexity of modern content distribution.

## 🎨 Visual Philosophy

The design of Vellum is centered around **high-utility minimalism**.

* **The Bento Grid:** Modular feature sets encapsulated in 1px borders (`#E5E5E5`) with 12px radii.
* **Typography:** Primary use of the **Inter** typeface with tight tracking (-0.04em) for a premium, editorial feel.
* **Whitespace:** Aggressive use of negative space to reduce cognitive load during multi-platform scheduling.
* **Textures:** Subtle 2\% grain overlays and dot-grid backgrounds to simulate the tactile feel of vellum paper.

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

Designed for speed, reliability, and "smooth-as-paper" transitions.

* **Frontend:** Next.js 14 (App Router)
* **Styling:** Tailwind CSS (Custom Greyscale Palette)
* **Animations:** GSAP + Lottie-Web (60fps vector motion)
* **Typography:** Inter Variable
* **Icons:** Custom stroke-based iconography (1.5px weight)

## 📜 Design Guidelines

To maintain the Vellum aesthetic when contributing:

* **Avoid Color:** Use the greyscale spectrum (#FFFFFF to #0A0A0A).
* **Motion First:** Every state change should have a 0.3s ease-out transition.
* **Grid Fidelity:** All elements must align to the 8px base grid.
